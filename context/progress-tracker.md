# Progress Tracker

Update this file after every meaningful implementation
change.

## Current Phase

- In Progress

## Current Goal

- 02-layout and workspace scaffold

## Completed

- **01-design-system**: Installed and configured shadcn/ui (Tailwind v4), added Button, Card, Input, Textarea, Tabs, ScrollArea, Dialog components, installed lucide-react, created lib/utils.ts with cn() helper, configured CSS variables for light/dark themes aligned to project palette from ui-context.md.

## In Progress

- None yet.

## Next Up

- 02-layout and workspace scaffold (navbar, sidebar, main panels)

## Open Questions

- None currently.

## Architecture Decisions

- shadcn/ui initialized with Tailwind v4 support (`shadcn@latest` CLI, `components.json` with `tailwind.version: "4"`)
- CSS design tokens: project-specific variables (`--bg-base`, `--bg-surface`, `--accent-primary`, etc.) are the source of truth; shadcn tokens (`--background`, `--primary`, etc.) are wired to them via `var()` references so both conventions work seamlessly

## Session Notes

- Build passes cleanly after 01-design-system implementation
- All 7 shadcn components in `components/ui/`, `lib/utils.ts` with `cn()` in place
- Light/dark theme via `.dark` class (no hardcoded colors anywhere)
